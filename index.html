                <p>Hey hun! We are Jamie and Dana of LBA, licensed acupuncturists in the state of Pennsylvania. We started treating patients together during our third year of graduate school at the Won Institute Acupuncture Clinic. We immediately shared a love for combining different styles of acupuncture and for integrating its endless wisdom into our lives. We wanted to keep working together, so we are!</p>
                <p>LBA is here to serve the larger creation of access to deep care, and to bring ourselves and our community health and joy. We hope to see you on the table!  </p>

                <p>I'm Dana, I love all things that make a wise and happy life. As a licensed PA acupuncturist and graduate of the Won Institute, I am trained in multiple traditions including Traditional Chinese Medicine and physical acupuncture; however, I focus most of my practice on Five Element Acupuncture. It's a tradition that works like poetry, bypassing the intellect and our over-active brains and simply landing with our hearts. This in turn gives us shifted perspectives, paths forward, recognition of our innate nature and a sense of our wholeness. adore acupuncture because it can connect us with what we need to be well, and brings beauty to our seasons of life.</p>
