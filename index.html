                <p>Hello there! I'm Jamie. I'm a chihuahua mom, gardener, weightlifting enthusiast, and most importantly for our purposes here, a licensed acupuncturist in the state of Pennsylvania. I love this medicine and after three long years of study and clinical internship at the Won Institute of Graduate studies, I'm thrilled to be here offering it in my community. During my time in student clinic, I fell in love with treating myofascial pain and injury. If you have pain or muscle stiffness on the regular, I'm your girl. That being said, I also find great joy in treating for other concerns like anxiety, depression, digestive disharmony, and women's health. No matter the concern, my goal is always to send you back into the world after treatment with feelings of relief and ease and a smile on your face. I hope to meet you soon.</p>

                <p>I'm Dana, I love all things that make a wise and happy life. As a licensed PA acupuncturist and graduate of the Won Institute, I am trained in multiple traditions including Traditional Chinese Medicine and physical acupuncture; however, I focus most of my practice on Five Element Acupuncture. It's a tradition that works like poetry, bypassing the intellect and our over-active brains and simply landing with our hearts. This in turn gives us shifted perspectives, paths forward, recognition of our innate nature and a sense of our wholeness. adore acupuncture because it can connect us with what we need to be well, and brings beauty to our seasons of life.</p>
